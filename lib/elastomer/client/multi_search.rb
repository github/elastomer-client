  class Client

    # Execute an array of searches in bulk. Results are returned in an
    # array in the order the queries were sent.
    #
    # The `multi_search` method can be used in two ways. Without a block
    # the method will perform an API call, and it requires a bulk request
    # body and optional request parameters.
    #
    # See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-multi-search.html
    #
    # body   - Request body as a String (required if a block is not given)
    # params - Optional request parameters as a Hash
    # block  - Passed to a MultiSearch instance which assembles the searches
    #          into a single request.
    #
    # Examples
    #
    #   # index and type in request body
    #   multi_search(request_body)
    #
    #   # index in URI
    #   multi_search(request_body, :index => 'default-index')
    #
    #   # block form
    #   multi_search(:index => 'default-index') do |m|
    #     m.search({:query => {:match_all => {}}, :search_type => :count)
    #     m.search({:query => {:field => {"foo" => "bar"}}}, :type => 'default-type')
    #     ...
    #   end

    # The MultiSearch class is a helper for accumulating and submitting

    # Elasticsearch, which runs all accumulated searches in parallel

    # hashes.

    # the block form of Client#multi_search.
