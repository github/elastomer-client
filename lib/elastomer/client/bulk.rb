    # The `bulk` method can be used in two ways. Without a block the method
    # will perform an API call, and it requires a bulk request body and
    # optional request parameters.
    #
    # body   - Request body as a String (required if a block is _not_ given)
    # params - Optional request parameters as a Hash
    # block  - A Bulk instance is passed to the block and is used to
    #          accumulate bulk operations.
    #
    # Examples
    #
    #   bulk( request_body, :index => 'default-index' )
    #
    #   bulk( :index => 'default-index' ) do |b|
    #     b.index( document1 )
    #     b.index( document2 )
    #     b.delete( document3 )
    #     ...
    #   end
    #
    # Returns the response body as a Hash

    # The Bulk class provides some abstractions and helper methods for working
    # with the ElasticSearch bulk API command. Instances of the Bulk class
    # accumulate indexing and delete operations and then issue a single bulk
    # API request to ElasticSearch. Those operations are then executed by the
    # cluster.
    #
    # A minimum request size can be set. As soon as the size of the request
    # body hits this threshold, a bulk request will be made to the search
    # cluster. This happens as operations are added.
    #
    # You can also use the `call` method explicitly to send a bulk requestion
    # immediately.
